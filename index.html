        <p class="mintitle" style="top: -15px;">Apple’s CEO sets September return to offices in flexible setup.</p>
       
        <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
        <p class="mintext" style=" left: -0px; top: 0px; padding-left: 15px;">Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Wednesday employees should begin returning to offices in early September for at least three days a week. The iPhone maker is pushing staff to return on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at a minimum, with remote work still an option for Wednesdays and Fridays, Cook said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.<br><br>

        “We are setting consistent days in the office to help us optimize our time for in-person collaboration,” he wrote. Some teams will have to be in four or five days a week.<br><br>
        
        In pushing for staff to return, Cook cited the availability of vaccinations and declining coronavirus infection rates.Some employees of the Cupertino, California-based technology.</p>

        <div class="col-4">
            <p class="mintext" style="left: -40px;">
                Cook said “many” Apple teams in the Asia and Pacific regions have already returned to offices and factories, and that the remaining closed retail stores will reopen this month. He previously told staff they might return as early as June, but the company pushed that back to September a few weeks ago.<br><br>

The Apple Park campus stands in this aerial photograph taken above Cupertino, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019. Apple Inc. will report its fourth-quarter results next week, and based on the average analyst price target for the stock, Wall Street is feeling increasingly optimistic about the iPhone maker’s prospects.<br><br>

Employees, with manager approval, will be offered an additional two weeks of remote work per year.
